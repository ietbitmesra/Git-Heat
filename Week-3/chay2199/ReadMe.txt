Future improvements and promises:
Currently the game consists of only two level with a poor search algorithms for the ghosts so that they can find you.
This makes the game pretty easy. The future levels may come with a better algorithm to make the game more challenging
  with sound effects, pause button, avatar etc. and I might convert the game into .exe so that everyone can play it easily.
