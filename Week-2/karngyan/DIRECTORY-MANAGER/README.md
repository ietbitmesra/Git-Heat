# Directory Manager 

This is my solution to the [Git-Heat Week-2 Problem](https://github.com/ietbitmesra/Git-Heat/tree/master/Week-2) organised by IET BIT Mesra.

* Input: Path of a directory
* Output: 
	* Pie Charts of file, folder, file-type distribution
	* Size of directory
	* Size of sub-directory/files

* This is a dash app written in Python3
* Modules/packages used: os, plotly, dash


NOTE: This cannot be deployed as a web app as web application cannot have access to visitor's file system. 

## About Dash

Dash is a productive Python framework for building web applications.

Written on top of Flask, Plotly.js, and React.js, Dash is ideal for building data visualization apps with highly custom user interfaces in pure Python. It's particularly suited for anyone who works with data in Python.
