This disk space analyser uses packages like os, sys, platform, ctypes, psutil, matplotlib, win32api etc.
It provides the following features:
1) Moving from one directory to other.
2) Listing all sub-directories and files.
3) Changing the parent directory.
4) Going back to the root directory.
5) Finding out the used space and free space of a directory.
6) Finding out the file size of a selected file.


*NOTE*
The program might not work if you have not installed the specified library and python 3.
It will alse not work properly if some files are broken while calculating the size of a
  directory or if you do not have the required permission to access some of the directories.


In these cases all that the program can do is to tell you what's wrong. You can try again after
  fixing these problems.
